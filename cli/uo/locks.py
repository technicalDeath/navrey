"""One instance of a looping script at a time.

Two copies of the same loop running against one character is not a small problem, and it does not
announce itself. Two autoheal.py both see the same low HP, both start a bandage, and the second
`use` lands on a target cursor the first one opened - one bandage is consumed for nothing and the
cursor is left dangling. Two combat_movement.py each re-issue `goto` at the target every ~0.4s,
and since a new walk cancels the running one (last-wins, by design), the character stutters in
place instead of closing. Neither shows up as an error: the log looks like a script that is simply
doing badly.

The failure is easy to cause. A background script has no window, `ps` output is noisy, and after a
compaction or a resumed session the orchestrator has no memory of what it launched - so
"relaunching" a healer that never stopped is the normal accident, not an exotic one.

So the loop claims a lock at startup and refuses to run if something already holds it. This mirrors
AgentLock on the C# side, which stops two clients owning one command file, and for the same reason:
refuse up front, because the alternative failure is a mystery.

        return 1

An OS file lock, not a pid file. The lock lives on an open file descriptor, so the kernel drops it when the
process ends - including on `kill -9`, a crash, or a terminal that went away. There is no stale
lock to detect, no liveness check to get wrong, and no window where a script refuses to start
because its predecessor died badly. The pid written into the file body is for the error message
only; the OS lock is the truth. Unix uses flock; Windows uses a nonblocking byte-range lock.

The file is never unlinked. Deleting a locked file races - another process can be holding the same
path open, and the next acquirer would lock an unlinked inode that nobody else can see. A leftover
unlocked file costs nothing and means exactly "nothing is running".

Locks are scoped to a command file, so two clients driven with -cmdfile do not block each other's
scripts.
